**`Git/Github Adventure`**

### 1. Collaborating on a Shared Project [_A First Git Team Exercise_](https://github.com/hunter-college-ossd-fall-2019/git-activity-01)

I did a Git activity in class, I found that it was useful and I was able to finish it in the given time. I think I was only able to finish it because I already have some experience with Git/Github. Of course, there were some merge conflicts. For example, three people were trying to push their repositories at the same time. I wanted to solve this issue using the given instructions to request an updated repository from other teammates using the Pull command before the Push command. However, there was another issue with that. I forgot what the exact error message was, however, I was able to solve it. I Googled the problem and found a solution from StackOverflow.  
  
Overall, I enjoyed the class and in doing so I learned how to use Git/Github. I am currently working on a group project, but none of us are experts in using them. We were discussing ways in which we can avoid merge conflicts and decided to use Branch a couple of weeks ago without understanding what it really is and how it works. So, I was glad to not only read the Pro Git book but also put my new knowledge into practice through participating in the collaboration activity.

### 2. Reading [A Beginner’s Very Bumpy Journey Through The World of Open Source](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/a-beginners-very-bumpy-journey-through-the-world-of-open-source-4d108d540b39/)  

The author's advice to fellow beginning developers who want to contribute to open source:  
>  - Tip #1: Don’t be afraid to ask questions  
>  - Tip #2: It’s OK to have holes in your knowledge  
>  - Tip #3: Just start
  
Those three tips really helped me release my nervousness before putting my step on the open source community. I was afraid of  being involved in projects, and I had discouraged myself from participating due to my lack of both coding and English skills.
