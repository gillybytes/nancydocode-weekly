### Opening an Issue
Suppose that you have been asked to review the blog post of a user named Shakespeare.

  1. Your goal is to open issues on _GitHub_ for one or more of Shakespeare's posts. Examine the post first for formatting problems. To do this you must be reading the web-page version of the blog, i.e., the one whose URL ends, for example, in "github.io/shakespeare-weekly". Read each post first for spelling errors, then for grammar errors that you can detect, then usage. Grammar errors are sometimes obvious. For example, "who argued so **_good_**" should be "who argued so **_well_**." Usage is when the wrong words or expressions are used in a sentence, like "Quicksort was faster **_then_** selection
sort" should be "Quicksort was faster **_than_** selection sort." For each mistake or weakness that you find, open a separate issue. If you think a sentence is just bad for one reason or another, open an issue and try to state constructively how it could be improved.
  2. To open an issue, click the Issues tab near the top of the page, and on that tab, click the green button on the right hand side labeled "New Issue". In the page that opens, fill in the Title text box with a good and short title, and then describe the issue in the area below that. You should use links to the posts as needed, or copy and paste the text in question. When you are finished, click the green Submit Issue button below the text area.

### Resolving Issues and Submitting Pull Requests
  1. Fork a copy of Shakespeare's repository.
  2. Clone this fork to your local machine.
  3. Make whatever changes you think are necessary to the blog post in your cloned copy.
  4. When you think that a particular change is good and complete, stage it using the git add command, and commit the staged change with a good commit message, using the git commit command.
  5. Repeat the preceding instruction for each independent change that you make. If there are multiple mistakes that you are trying to fix, or improvements that you are trying to make, each should have its own commit with a distinct and descriptive commit message. This way it is easier to keep track of what was done, and to accept or reject them independently.
  6. When you are all finished with these changes, you are ready to push them to your upstream fork of Shakespeare's repository. 
  7. Push your changes to your remote using the git push command.
  8. You are now ready to issue a pull request. Open the _GitHub_ page with _your fork_ of Shakespeare's repository. Click on the gray button labeled "New Pull Request". GitHub will display a page with the heading "Comparing changes".  
    - If you are able to merge your changes into Shakespeare's repository, you will see some green text stating, "Able to merge".  
    - If _GitHub_ is not able to merge your changes automatically, you will see instead the message "Can't automatically merge". Click the "View Pull Request" button, and in the new page, click the gray "Resolve conflicts" button.
