**`3. What I Edited To a Classmate's Blog Post Following the Given Procedure`**

- Opening an Issue
Suppose that you have been asked to review the blog post of a user named Shakespeare.

1. Your goal is to open issues on _GitHub_ for one or more of Shakespeare's posts. Examine the post first for formatting problems. To do this you must be reading the web-page version of the blog, i.e., the one whose URL ends, for example, in "github.io/shakespeare-weekly". Read each post first for spelling errors, then for grammar errors that you can detect, then usage. Grammar errors are sometimes obvious. For example, "who argued so **_good_**" should be "who argued so **_well_**." Usage is when the wrong words or expressions are used in a sentence, like "Quicksort was faster **_then_** selection
sort" should be "Quicksort was faster **_than_** selection sort." For each mistake or weakness that you find, open a separate issue. If you think a sentence is just bad for one reason or another, open an issue and try to state constructively how it could be improved.

2. To open an issue, click the Issues tab near the top of the page, and on that tab, click the green button on the right hand side labeled New Issue. In the page that opens, ll in the Title text box with a good and short title, and then describe the issue in the area below that. You should use links to the posts as needed, or copy and paste the text in question. When you are nished, click the green Submit Issue button below the text area.
