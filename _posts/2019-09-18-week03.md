**`10 Things You Should Know about Open Source Before You Use It`**

Some of the ten statements discussed in this [short article](https://www.techrepublic.com/blog/10-things/10-things-you-should-know-about-open-source-before-you-use-it/) are things I might have thought before taking this course, and some I still might not have realized. Let me write what I have learned so far with respect to these statements. For example, did I know that it is not always free of cost? Let me try to be specific and try to give examples.

  1. It's not just for Linux
    > Yes. Speaking of open source, I think of Linux first. The second thing I was familiar with was that the [MEAN stack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MEAN_) which is a open source software bundle. In addition, there were a lot of open source projects that I explored last time as a class assignment.  
  2. It's not always free  
  3. It may or may not have support  
    > I don't think much about support before using something. When buying hardware like the iPhone, if you give me an option for some kind of support at the point of sale, I'll start thinking about it, or if it's a service, just return / return. And support seemed to come along naturally whatever. If you're having trouble using the product, I've been thinking that you can find a way to solve it through a variety of contact methods, including online chat, phone, and email. Until you use Hiroku. When I searched the internet to create and deploy a small web app, I tried to install Hiroku, which offers a free service unless I expect a lot of visitors. However, even after following the installation method several times, I did not get the desired result.Slack. When I joined the slack and asked a question, it wasn't just who answered it, but it seemed that random people, like stack overflow, saw and answered my questions. Hiroku isn't open source, but maybe it's this way if you provide support from open source. I couldn't find a solution right away, but it was better than nothing at all. Even if an open source project does not provide support separately, it would not be bad if various people gathered various problems all over the Internet in this way and bundled them together to provide support. If I think about when I started some open source project in the future.    
  4. You have full access to the source code
  5. Open source is not just for programmers
  6. You aren't breaking any laws by adopting open source
  > 사실 잘 모르겠다. 위키디피아 창시자가 정부와 맞서 싸우다가 결국엔 자살을 선택한 다큐멘터리를 본 적이 있다. 이 스테이트먼트는 이미 존재하는 오픈 소스를 내 필요에 맞춰 (라이센스가 허용하는 범위 내에서) 얼마든지 바꿔 사용해도 된다는 말이겠지만 크게 와 닿지는 않는다. 하지만 교수님이 수업시간에 언급하신 프린터를 사용함에 있어 필요한 것들을 업데이트해서 사용한 예시는 무척 좋았다.(4) 내가 굳이 오픈 소스를 사용하는데 있어서 프로그래머여야 하거나(5) 엑스퍼트일 필요는 없지만(7) 그래도 내가 필요했을 때 큰 어려움 없이 바로 어답트해서 사용할 수 있으면 정말 멋지겠다 싶은 생각이 나를 더 지금하고 있는 컴퓨터 공부가 재미있게 느껴지게 했다.
  7. You don't have to be an expert to use it
  8. Most open source software is as reliable as its proprietary counterpart  
  9. Freeware and shareware are not the same as open source  
  10. You're probably already using it

  - Read [An explanation of the Open Source Way](https://opensource.com/open-source-way)
  - Read the Getting Started chapter in the [Pro Git book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) including the section on installing Git, and read the second chapter, Git Basics, up to and including the section, Recording Changes to the Repository.
  - Read the instructions in [git-activity-01](https://github.com/hunter-college-ossd-fall-2019/git-activity-01)
  - Learnt examples of Open Source beyond software: Open data, open hardware, open government, open education
    - [Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/)
    - [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/)
  - Learnt an introduction to [Version Control System and Git](http://www.compsci.hunter.cuny.edu/~sweiss/course_materials/csci395.86/slides/version_control_systems.html#1)
    - What is a version control system?
    - What is Git?
    - What is GitHub and how is it different from Git?
    - How can you work in Git on your local machine and synchronize your work with copies of it elsewhere, such as on GitHub?  - Followed the OpenStreetMap editing tutorial and tried to complete at least one edit to the map
  - Installed Git on my laptop and configure Git following the instructions in :First-Time Git Setup" in the Pro Git book
