**`10 Things You Should Know about Open Source Before You Use It`**

##### Some of the ten statements discussed in this [short article](https://www.techrepublic.com/blog/10-things/10-things-you-should-know-about-open-source-before-you-use-it/) are things I might have thought before taking this course, and some I still might not have realized. Let me write what I have learned so far with respect to these statements. For example, did I know that it is not always free of cost? Try to be specific and try to give examples.

  1. It's not just for Linux
  2. It's not always free
  3. It may or may not have support
  4. You have full access to the source code
  5. Open source is not just for programmers
  6. You aren't breaking any laws by adopting open source
  7. You don't have to be an expert to use it
  8. Most open source software is as reliable as its proprietary counterpart  
  9. Freeware and shareware are not the same as open source  
  10. You're probably already using it
