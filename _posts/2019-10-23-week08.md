### Visit by Bill Reyner from [FactSet](https://www.factset.com/)
There are many financial services companies in New York City, and I am interested in working in the field after my graduation. Bill Reyner from FactSet came to visit my Open Source Project Development class. His presentation showed me a whole picture of the industry and a glimpse of their actual application program. It was interesting to hear why his company chose open source ways. Not only for their clients to be transparent, but also to encourage their employees to get involved in the open source community so that they can feel that they are helping others while working for giant corporations, especially finance. 

I looked into Fintech Open Source Foundation (FINOS) right after he mentioned it. I was glad to know that there is an open source community for Fintech. I only assumed that it would be impossible to see inside the financial program unless I become an intern or full-time employee. There would be limits due to security reasons, but still, it was exciting to know that I could get hands-on experience with Fintech. For my current project, Kodi, I am having difficulty finding ways to contribute other than translation work, so I am thinking of doing another evaluation on [Perspective](https://github.com/finos/perspective) if I need to contribute only through GitHub’s issues.
