**`Open Source, How Far Can You Go`**

### Summary of In-class Activities
- On Thursday, November 14, we've discussed about the importance of an Open source firmware.  

- On Monday, November 18, we had a time to find out software projects that meet a social need - Humanitarian Free and Open Source Software (HFOSS). 

  Two classes continued to show the open source community's impact on real life.

### Assignments
- [x] Did all of the exercises from the slide Exercises 1 in the Linux Tutorial by November 18  

1. To solve the first question, I had [to install _coreutils_ first in my Mac OS system](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/142860/install-shuf-on-os-x) to use bash command because of the `Error #1. -bash: shuf: command not found`. Then I loocked up the [Shuf Command Tutorial for Begginers](https://www.ostechnix.com/the-shuf-command-tutorial-with-examples-for-beginners/).  
      
2. In the beggining, I couldn't sure about the _absolute path_, so I referenced below:  
    - "An absolute path is defined as the specifying the location of a file or directory from the root directory(/)."  
      _from [Absolute and Relative Pathnames in UNIX](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/absolute-relative-pathnames-unix/)_

    - "The name of a user's home directory is by default identical to that of the user. Thus, for example, a user with a user name of mary would typically have a home directory named mary. It would have an absolute pathname of /home/mary. An absolute pathname is the location of a directory or file relative to the root directory, and it always starts with the root directory (i.e., with a forward slash)."  
      _from [Home Directory Definition](http://www.linfo.org/home_directory.html)_  
  
3. Saw other's answers, and it produced same result with mine with much simpler code: `ls | head -10 *`.

- [x] Read [Election fraud: Is there an open source solution?](https://opensource.com/article/19/9/voting-fraud-open-source-solution?) by November 20
  
  The article points out that the old machines can malfunction, but rather, the trivial problems of software that seem to be unconnected are entangled together like a chain of chains, made that fair election management is impossible. However, some people believe that open-source technologies could solve this.
 
  I remember the experiment of observing how the paper became stronger when it gets more. A piece of paper can be torn easily, but wh  Individual people  may not have much influence, but when a group of people with goodwill come together, the world can be changed, and that would be the power of the open-source community.
 
Humanity is not perfect. We do make mistakes. Technology is made by humans; that is why there are flaws. I can see how open-source is beneficial, but I guess there will be another problem. An important thing is ordinary people like us try to make a better world together.
