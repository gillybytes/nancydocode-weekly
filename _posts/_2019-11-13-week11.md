### Assignment  
- Wikipedia Contributions
  - [Bakridamae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bakridamae)
  
- Read [System76 introduces laptops with open source BIOS coreboot](https://opensource.com/article/19/11/coreboot-system76-laptops?utm_campaign=intrel)  
and in your blog for Week 11, explain the significance of this. Not required, but strongly suggested before you start to write anything is to read  

- Read [Open Firmware](https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2019/10/239673-open-source-firmware/fulltext)  
by Jessie Frazelle, to understand the issue more clearly. To quote the author, "The goal of this article is to provide some insight into what is being built with open source firmware and why making firmware open source is so important."  

- Do all of the exercises from the slide Exercises 1 in the Linux Tutorial. I have created private repositories on GitHub for each of you, named with your username and linux-activities. Within that repository, put your solutions in the directory linux_hwk1. Name the file in that directory exercise-set-1.
