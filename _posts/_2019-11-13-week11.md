### Assignment  
- Wikipedia Contributions
  - [Bakridamae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bakridamae)
  
- Read [System76 introduces laptops with open source BIOS coreboot](https://opensource.com/article/19/11/coreboot-system76-laptops?utm_campaign=intrel)  

  기사는 펌웨어를 오픈 소스화한 2대의 컴퓨터 출시를 알리고 있다. 이 제품들은 보통 운영체제가 오픈 소스여도 펌웨어만큼은 클로즈화 되어 있던 것을 커뮤니티의 도움으로 해결하였으며, 제품화뿐만 아니라 판매로까지 이어지게 하였다. 이는 기존의 대형 회사에서 임의로 사용자에게 필요할 것들을 선택해 만든 완제품에서 벗어나 사용자가 필요하면 컴퓨터의 하나부터 열까지 들여다보고 변경할 수 있는 자유를 주었다는 데에서 의의가 있다고 본다. 코드에 익숙하지 않은 일반인들에게도 접근이 용이하도록 커뮤니티가 확대되는 게 풀어할 숙제이지 않을까 싶다.

- Read [Open Firmware](https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2019/10/239673-open-source-firmware/fulltext)  
by Jessie Frazelle, to understand the issue more clearly. To quote the author, "The goal of this article is to provide some insight into what is being built with open source firmware and why making firmware open source is so important."  

- Do all of the exercises from the slide Exercises 1 in the Linux Tutorial. I have created private repositories on GitHub for each of you, named with your username and linux-activities. Within that repository, put your solutions in the directory linux_hwk1. Name the file in that directory exercise-set-1.
