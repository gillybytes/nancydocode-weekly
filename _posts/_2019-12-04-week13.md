- [x] Read the article by Tom Callaway about business models in open source, [Musings on Open Source Software Business Models](https://spot.livejournal.com/327801.html)  
  I am glad to know what kind of business model open source projects might have by reading this article. It would've been better article, if it gave more specific examples. It mentioned some companies like Red Hat and MongoDB, but I couldn't get the full idea how to apply this to the beggining stage of any companies. So, these models are based on the assumption that there are certain number of customers use that open source softwares. All the open source companies began without thinking of making any revenues, then once it gets popular which needs some management and has potential to apply business model, then that's how the company can be?
