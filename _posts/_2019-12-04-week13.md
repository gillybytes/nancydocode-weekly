### Blog
- Write your comments about Tom Callaway's blog post.  
I am glad to know what kind of business model open source projects might have by reading this article. It would've been better article, if it gave more specific examples. It mentioned some companies like Red Hat and MongoDB, but I couldn't get the full idea how to apply this to the beggining stage of any companies. So, these models are based on the assumption that there are certain number of customers to use that open source softwares. All the open source companies began without thinking of making any revenues, then once it gets popular which needs some management and has potential to apply business model, then that's how the company can be?

- The second article is intended to convince CIO's about the importance of open source for companies. What are your reactions to this article?
- Would you want to work in a company that only produced open source software? Why or why not? What would your dream job be? How would you like to see the business of software production in ten years?
- There are no new blog requests for the week ending 12/04. Make sure to chronicle your progress, and update your contributions.
