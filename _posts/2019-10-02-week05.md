### 1. Explored the links from the [article](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/#finding-a-project-to-contribute-to) to find a project for my first contribution

  I found some projects that I may able to contribute to from [GitHub Explore](https://github.com/explore). GitHub Explore consists of five sections: Explore; Topics; Trending; Collections; and Events. I found [MunGell/awesome-for-beginners](https://github.com/MunGell/awesome-for-beginners) repository in Trending. Its README.md explains about the `first-timers-only` label. 

  I looked at some [open issues labeled 'first-timers-only' on Github](https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=label%3Afirst-timers-only+is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen&type=) and it seems very competitive. I sorted the issues by Newest to see whether there was something I could start to work on, but everything had been taken by someone. Overall, this was very useful and I think I can find projects to contribute to. I just need to keep checking the new issue under 'first-timers-only' and comment "THIS IS MINE!" asap before other people to start it.

### 2. Git/GitHub activities in the class

  I've learned about Git/GitHub in class by following the [github-workflow-activity-01](https://github.com/hunter-college-ossd-fall-2019/github-workflow-activity-01). It was all manageable to do up to Step 6 - Contribute to the Project. There was another link - [Contribution Workflow](https://github.com/hunter-college-ossd-fall-2019/github-workflow-activity-01/blob/master/contribution-workflow.md). It was easy only because there were guidelines, but it would have been difficult without the guidelines. I was happy to see how the changes from my branch linked directly to the pull request. However, I feel that I need to study more on my own to learn including how the branch works. I will review the resources which we went over in class. The activity itself was helpful in understanding the full workflow.
