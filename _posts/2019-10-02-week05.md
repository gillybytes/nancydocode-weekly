### 1. The [article](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/#finding-a-project-to-contribute-to) on finding a project to which you can contribute has a great amount of information and advice. It also has links to other webpages that help you in finding projects. Explore these links and comment on which might prove to be useful, and whether they have helped you to narrow down your search.
