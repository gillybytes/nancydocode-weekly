**`Evaluation of Open Source Project`**

### [Project Evaluation](https://github.com/hunter-college-ossd-fall-2019/nancydocode-weekly/blob/gh-pages/files/project-evalutaion.pdf)
I evaluated a project called [Kodi](https://kodi.tv/). It is a free media player designed to look great on a big screen TV. I spent some time answering all the evaluation questions, but it was manageable. There was one question that I was not sure how to answer: “How many people are maintaining the project?”, found in the Activity Level section. I chose 51 people based on their contributions, who contributed commits more than 90 times, but there are also 83 people in the Kodi Team.

The project’s homepage and Github repository are well maintained and the community is active. I ended up reading their history after answering “in 2013” to the question “When was this project first started?”. It was not a long history compared to the history of humanity, but to me it felt like it was. I admired how the project has been adjusted to the user’s wishes, and continues to grow.
