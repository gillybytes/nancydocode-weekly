**`Why I decided to take a course in open source software development`**

The first time I heard about open source was probably because of Ubuntu. I kept hearing about it a lot ever since, but Iâ€™m one of those who think that posting a project on GitHub would refer to the open source activity. One more thing I know about it is that people around the world voluntarily participate in many projects to develop ideas together online, and they help other people. I would like to become part of that commutity to make an impact on the world, so that is the reason I decided to take this course. I am excited to have a chance to learn what open source is.


**`What I have done this week`**
  - Created GitHub, OpenStreetMap, and Wikipedia accounts
  - Followed a [Markdown Tutorial](https://www.markdowntutorial.com/) and read a [Markdown Cheastsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)
