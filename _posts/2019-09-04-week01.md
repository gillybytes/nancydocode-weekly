# why I decided to take a course in open source software

The first time I heard about Open Source was probably because of Ubuntu is what my college CS lab computers use. I've heard about it a lot ever since, but I'm one of those who knew that posting a project on GitHub would refer to the activity. Another thing I know about it is that people around the world voluntarily participate in multiple projects to develop ideas together online and those actually help a lot of other people. That is why I register in this class and I am excited to have a chance to get to know what Open Source truly is through the course.
