**`Why I decided to take a course in open source software`**

The first time I heard about Open Source was probably because of Ubuntu. I kept hearing about it a lot ever since, but I'm one of those who think that posting a project on GitHub would refer to the open source activity. One more thing I know about it is that people around the world voluntarily participate in multiple projects to develop ideas together online and those actually help other people. I am excited to have a chance to get to know what Open Source truly is through the course.
