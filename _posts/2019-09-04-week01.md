**`I Decided to Take a Course in Open Source Software Development`**

The first time I heard about open source was probably because of Ubuntu. I kept hearing about it a lot ever since, but Iâ€™m one of those who think that posting a project on GitHub would refer to the open source activity. One more thing I know about it is that people around the world voluntarily participate in many projects to develop ideas together online, and those projects really help other people. I would like to become part of that commutity to make an impact on the world, so that is the reason I decided to take this course. I am excited to have a chance to learn what open source is through this course [CSci 395.86, Open Source Software Development](http://www.compsci.hunter.cuny.edu/~sweiss/course_materials/csci395.86/cs395.86_f19.php) with professor [Stewart Weiss](http://www.compsci.hunter.cuny.edu/~sweiss/personal.php).
