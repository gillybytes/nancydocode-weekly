### Eric Raymond's [The Cathedral and the Bazaar](http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/index.html)

Eric Raymond wrote about his journey on how he finally found full trust in an open source communities, in his writing of ‘The Cathedral and the Bazaar’. Even he himself was already involved in the development of the open source project - first GNU, yet he still considered open source projects only to be useful for small non-serious programs.

He compared working on big and important projects to ‘building like cathedrals, carefully crafted by individual wizards, or small bands of mages working in splendid isolation’. He also compared open source projects to ‘resembling a great babbling bazaar of different agendas and approaches’.

These comparisons remind me of two things. One, is what makes New York City great, in spite of some its faults, in which I mean that the city is not perfect. All the different people from different countries provide all of the unique aspects that makes New York so great. The other, is a Hunter College slogan, which states, “We are of different opinions at different hours, but we always may be said to be at heart on the side of truth.” It may look chaotic, but if it touches simple and basic principles, as it calls ‘truth’, then it will eventually reach a conclusion. I think that is how the Linux world works.

1. The Mail Must Get Through  
  _1. Every good work of software starts by scratching a developer's personal itch_  
	yes, that’s why I tried to translate documents into another language.  
  _5. When you lose interest in a program, your last duty to it is to hand it off to a competent successor_  
	yes, yes, yes. That’s why I changed my project.  
2. The Importance of Having Users  
3. Release Early, Release Often

### Final Project - FreeCodeCamp
I changed my final project from Kodi to FreeCodeCamp. So far, I did:

- Read three documents
  - [Code of Conduct](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/code-of-conduct/)
  - [Contributing](https://github.com/nancydocode/freeCodeCamp/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
  - [How to Setup freeCodeCamp Locally](https://github.com/nancydocode/freeCodeCamp/blob/master/docs/how-to-setup-freecodecamp-locally.md)
  
- Issues
  - Found one typo from the issue(https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/issues/36773) while I was looking into. I will work on to fix it, once I finished to read how-to-setup-freecodecamp-locally.md.

  _If you have a multi-dimensional array, you can use the same logic as the prior waypoint to loop through both the array and any sub-arrays. [related link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/nesting-for-loops)_

  - And I found that there is no translation in Korean of how-to-setup-freecodecamp-locally.md, so I will also work on this too.

### In-Class Activity(10/21 - 10/24)
It becomes clear enough to understand how the branches are working once I saw it visually using gitg (Git Repository Viewer [install on Mac OS](https://brewinstall.org/install-gitg-on-mac-with-brew/)). However, I could not grasp the whole flow because I was too busy to follow the professor’s instructions, and I was not learning through trial and error by myself. I will review the tutorial before the next class.

My quiz scores were below the average. I reviewed only one [slide](), and even then I guess I didn’t give the correct answer to the related problem. I think that I am having trouble tryig to figure out what the problem is about, and what to study. Next time, I will try to make sure by asking somebody else, either the professor or my classmates, about it.

- [Presentation](http://www.compsci.hunter.cuny.edu/~sweiss/course_materials/csci395.86/slides/collaborating_workflows.html#1) about Safe Ways to Use Git for Coordinating With Others  
- [Git Activity Instructions](https://github.com/hunter-college-ossd-fall-2019/git-collaboration-workflow-activity) - It simulates working with a team of contributors to an upstream project. It causes merge conflicts and shows you how to use git fetch, git merge, and git rebase to synchronize your work

### Assignment
1. Completed five contributions to OpenStreetMap
2. Read the [article](https://dri.es/balancing-makers-and-takers-to-scale-and-sustain-open-source)
3. Worked on finding issues to fix, or if you have already identified some, work on the issues themselves
