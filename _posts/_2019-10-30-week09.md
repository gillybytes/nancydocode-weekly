### In-Class Activity(10/21 - 10/24)
Today you will do another Git activity. This one is the most advanced to date. It simulates working with a team of contributors to an upstream project. It causes merge conflicts and shows you how to use git fetch, git merge, and git rebase to synchronize your work. The instructions are on GitHub in the repository https://github.com/hunter-college-ossd-fall-2019/git-collaboration-workflow-activity.
