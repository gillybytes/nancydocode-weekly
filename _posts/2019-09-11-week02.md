**`What types of contributions would be suitable choices for me to make with regard to my first contributions to an open source project?`**  

I am glad that I read "[How to Contribute to Open Source without Coding](https://icontribute.wordpress.com/how-to-contribute-to-open-source-without-coding/)" because I didn’t know that there are many ways for one to be involved with the open source community other than through programming. I have chosen some of the things from the list that I am probably going to do.

  - Translate the documentation (and program text) into another language  
    - I’ve translated some materials from the MDN Web Docs while following their Django tutorials and I will continue to do that.
  - Help write good documentation  
  - Create diagrams, screen-shots, and graphics for documentation
  - Provide training to new Linux users
  - Convince people to chose Open Source products when possible

**`What types of projects interest me and how do I see my relationship to them?`**
    
  - I am learning **Django** by following the [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Django) and I know there are some people in South Korea who are also interested in this **open source web framework**. There are some chapters that are not providedd in Korean, so I will translate them into the Korean language.
  - Wait. Am I misunderstood this question? What types of projects interest me... I am not sure what kinds of open source projects exist. So, I searched it - found [The 5 Types of Open Source Projects](https://wackowiki.org/doc/org/articles/5typesopensourceprojects) and [
  Examples of Popular Open Source Products and Types](https://www.nibusinessinfo.co.uk/content/examples-popular-open-source-products-and-types) which don't look like what I am really looking for. I am interested in some projects if they are existed making real products to help minority group. For example, create small and really cheap (more over affordable) computer to allow people be connected to the internet, so they can learn whenever, wherever they are. There should be also networking system, software to teach people who turn on this computer how to use it, private power station (maybe solor energy) so people who don't have access to electricity also able to use it, etc.
