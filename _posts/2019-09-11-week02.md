**`What types of contributions would be suitable choices for me to make with regard to my first contributions to an open source project?`**  

I am glad that I read "[How to Contribute to Open Source without Coding](https://icontribute.wordpress.com/how-to-contribute-to-open-source-without-coding/)" because I didn’t know that there are many ways for one to be involved with the open source community other than through programming. I have chosen some of the things from the list that I am probably going to do.

  - Translate the documentation (and program text) into another language  
    - I’ve translated some materials from the MDN Web Docs while following their Django tutorials and I will continue to do that.
  - Help write good documentation  
  - Create diagrams, screen-shots, and graphics for documentation
  - Provide training to new Linux users
  - Convince people to chose Open Source products when possible

**`What types of projects interest me and how do I see my relationship to them?`**
    
  - I am learning **Django** by following the [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Django) and I know there are some people in South Korea who are also interested in this **open source web framework**. There are some chapters that are not providedd in Korean, so I will translate them into the Korean language.
  - Wait. Did I misunderstand this question? Regarding the types of projects that interest me, I am not sure what kinds of open-source projects exist. So, I searched this and found [The 5 Types of Open Source Projects](https://wackowiki.org/doc/org/articles/5typesopensourceprojects) and [
  Examples of Popular Open Source Products and Types](https://www.nibusinessinfo.co.uk/content/examples-popular-open-source-products-and-types), which don't seem to be what I am looking for. I am interested in projects if they exist, making real products to help minority groups. For example, I am interested in creating a small and very inexpensive(more than just affordable) computer to allow people to connect to the internet - so they can learn at any time, no matter where they are. In addition, there should be a networking system, software to teach people who turn on the computer how to use it, and a private power station (maybe solar energy) so that people who don't have access to electricity can still use it, among other features.
  - Raspberry Pi. I have heard of this computer, but I am not entirely sure what it is. Apparently, some other people also were curious about whether the Raspberry Pi is open source - [Is Raspberry Pi open source?](  https://www.google.com/search?rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS784US785&sxsrf=ACYBGNR9Tz-a6e_fU3OdTdIaLZTvcPaCbw%3A1568165866585&ei=6k94XaumI_Gg_QbBvYa4Bw&q=raspberry+pi+open+source&oq=ras&gs_l=psy-ab.3.0.35i39l2j0i67l3j0i20i263j0i67l2j0l2.223223.225056..225859...1.4..0.89.331.4......0....1..gws-wiz.......0i71j0i131j0i10.8nH32XVWR50). The short answer to this is 50:50.
