**`What types of contributions are suitable choices to make as my first contributions to an open source project?`**  

I am glad to have read the [How to Contribute to Open Source without Coding](https://icontribute.wordpress.com/how-to-contribute-to-open-source-without-coding/) because I didn't know there are many other ways to be involved into the open source community besides of programming. I chose some of things from the list I am probably going to do.

  - Translate the documentation (and program text) into another language  
    - I've been translated some from the MDN Web Docs while following their Django tutorials and I will continue it.
  - Help write good documentation  
  - Create diagrams, screen-shots, and graphics for documentation
  - Provide training to new Linux users
  - Convince people to chose Open Source products when possible
