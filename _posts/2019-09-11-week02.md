**`What types of contributions are suitable choices to make as my first contributions to an open source project?`**
I am glad to have read the [How to Contribute to Open Source without Coding]() because I didn't know there are many other ways to be involved into the open source community besides of programming. I chose some of things from the list I am probably going to do.

  1. Translate the documentation (and program text) into another language  
    I've been translated some from the MDN Web Docs into Korean while following their Django tutorials and I will continue it.
  2. Create diagrams, screen-shots, and graphics for documentation
  3. Provide training to new Linux users
  4. Convince people to chose Open Source products when possible
