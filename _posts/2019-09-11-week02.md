**`What types of contributions would be suitable choices for me to make with regard to my first contributions to an open source project?`**  

I am glad that I read "[How to Contribute to Open Source without Coding](https://icontribute.wordpress.com/how-to-contribute-to-open-source-without-coding/)", because I didn’t know that there are many ways for one to be involved with the open source community other than through programming. I have chosen some of the things from the list that I am probably going to do.

  - Translate the documentation (and program text) into another language  
    - I’ve translated some materials from the MDN Web Docs while following their Django tutorials and I will continue to do that.
  - Help write good documentation  
  - Create diagrams, screen-shots, and graphics for documentation
  - Provide training to new Linux users
  - Convince people to chose Open Source products when possible

**`What types of projects interest me and how do I see my relationship to them?`**

  - I am a treasurer at **Hunter ACM** and I believe that there is something I can do to improve its _website_.
    - URL of the website: [https://www.hunteracm.org/](https://www.hunteracm.org/)
    - URL of the repository for the source code: [https://github.com/hunteracm/hunteracm.github.io](https://github.com/hunteracm/hunteracm.github.io)  
    
  - I am learning **Django** by following the [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Django) and I know there are some people in South Korea who are also interested in this **open source web framework**. There are some chapters that are not providedd in Korean, so I will translate them into the Korean language.
