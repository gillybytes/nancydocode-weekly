### Blog
When I decided to take the course Open Source Project Development, I thought that I might learn how to use the GitHub because (Open Source = GitHub) to me at that time. Looking back this semester left only one more class, I have learned a lot than I expected. First, I even didn’t know what open source truly means. And the most of all, writing a blog every week was something that I have tried to avoid at all cost since it has been about a year, I started to speak and write a short email in English. However, writing skill is essential because it is the primary way to communicate with others in the open-source communities. So, I tried to do my best using everything I can. I wrote down blogs in my mother language first, used the google translator to translate it into English, then polished it a little bit by myself, then hired an online tutor to review it before submitting it. It was not easy to deliver what I intended to say, and of course, it was a stressful journey. If it were not an assignment, I would have already given up. Professor’s feedback motivated me to continue to write a blog. I stopped using the google translator. I am just writing it. I accepted the fact I need to practice. I am still afraid to be embarrassed by my lack of English skills and wanted to run away from this situation. Rather than doing that, I will just do. I will study English grammar and vocabulary during this winter break.

My first contribution to the open-source project was translation, as I planned in the beginning. The project was different than I was looking for to work on, but I enjoyed it. It was freeCodeCamp, which is an online learning platform for those like to learn full-stack web development. I was also interested in learning web development. So, I was following the tutorials while I was translating a document. I’ve heard about this project before, but I thought it was a scam because of the name, including ‘free.’ I thought that there is no free stuff in the world. But, it turned out there is a free and good stuff like this open-source project. I am glad to know about this project and become a giver, not only a taker. I feel I become much closer to this community.

The course was a wholesome experience. I am sincerely thankful to my professor.
