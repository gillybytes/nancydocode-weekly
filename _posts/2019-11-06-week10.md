**`Wikipedia and Progress on the issue(freeCodeCamp)`**

### Investigating Wikipedia's pages
To be honest, I have not looked at Wikipedia very often because I am not familiar with either English or Western culture. However, I have found some errors about Korean culture on Wikipedia. I just haven’t thought about editing them, but I used to think it would be nice if someone did or perhaps it would be okay just to leave them as they are because no one would be interested anyway. I think this is the time to change my mind and try to edit as many errors as I can. (_I already did some!🎉 And It was fun than I thoguht! [See the contributions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Nancydocode))_

  - 💬 moT01  
  _❝ Yes, translation PR's are welcome without an issue - Here are the current Korean files - and there's one open PR for a Korean translation as well. So maybe take a quick look at those.❞_  
  - 💬 raisedadead  
  _❝ Please feel free to create a PR as directed.❞_

- Requested a pull #37707 and it was rejected
  - [Corrected a possible typo in basic-javascript/nesting-for-loops.english.md](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/pull/37707)
  - Because it was not a typo😂
  - 💬 RandellDawson   
  _❝ It can be either waypoint or way point, but typically is seen as waypoint, so I think we can close this PR. Thanks for checking though. 
  On a side note: It is highly recommended not to create PRs from your master branch. You want it to remain "clean" and only update it via the upstream master branch. You always should create a new branch from your locally synced master branch, push your changes to your fork and then create the pull request from the branch you pushed to your fork.❞_

**In the future**
- Going to submit a pull request once finished the translation

### In-class Activities
We read two presentations in the class this monday - [Open Encyclopedias](http://www.compsci.hunter.cuny.edu/~sweiss/course_materials/csci395.86/slides/wikipedia.html#1) and [Unix Tutorial, Part 1: Basics and Commands](http://www.compsci.hunter.cuny.edu/~sweiss/course_materials/csci395.86/slides/bash_tutorial_01.html#1). It was good to have time to know what is the wikidepia and unix basic commands and helped me to understand them better.
