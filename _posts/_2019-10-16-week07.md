**`Evaluation of Open Source Project`**

### Project Evaluation
For this week, your goal is to describe the project evaluation that you did. What was hard? what did you learn? Are you interested in the particular project that you evaluated now? What was the hardest task? Do not limit yourself to these questions.

### What I have Done This Week
- Evaluation of Open Source Project in the class
  - Read the [Instructions](https://github.com/hunter-college-ossd-fall-2019/project-evaluation-activity-01)
- Evaluation of Open Source Project outside of the class
