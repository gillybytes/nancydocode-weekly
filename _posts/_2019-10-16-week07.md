**Thursday, October 10: Project Exploration**
Overview:	Evaluation of Open Source Projects
The objective of today's class is to get as much experience learning how to evaluate open source projects as possible. You will be grouped into teams and then work on studying a single project.

**In-Class Activity**
Today you will do a team based project evaluation activity. The instructions are on GitHub in the repository https://github.com/hunter-college-ossd-fall-2019/project-evaluation-activity-01.

**Assignment due October 16:**
Pick another project, one that is not in the list of projects in the Wiki, i.e., no one evaluated it, and complete the evaluation of that project. Put the file in a private repository in the class organization and name it in the form Github_username_project_evaluation, substituting the name of the project for the word "project" and your GitHub username for the "Github_username".

**Blog Week 7 (ending 10/16):**
For this week, your goal is to describe the project evaluation that you did. What was hard? what did you learn? Are you interested in the particular project that you evaluated now? What was the hardest task? Do not limit yourself to these questions.
