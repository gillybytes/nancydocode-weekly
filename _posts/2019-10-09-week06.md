**`It is time to start searching for projects`**

# Q. It is time to start searching for projects. The above readings will help guide you in what to look for in a project. I will provide suggestions for where and how to look. In this week's blog, write about which projects you looked at, why you rejected them, which are still possible, and which look good to you. Treat your blog like a diary this week. Also comment on the talk by Karen Sandler.

Last week, I was searching the projects focusing on an issue with the First Timer label for my first open source contribution. Luckily, it wasn't hard to find issues because there were many projects encouraging people to have a contributing experience for Hacktoberfest. So, I did a few of them, and my pull requests were aceepted. I was thankful for what I have learned from the class like workflow and markdown without them, I might not able to try to contribute.

I decided to take a closer look at the project itself this week unlike before. I sorted projects through languages from CodeTriage and Up For Grabs mainly at C ++, HTML, JavaScript, Python, and Swift. First, I read a brief program description and went through Github repository to check how active the issues and pull requests are, and then put them on the list. Then, I started looking closely at each project. Based on the professor's advice, first, I checked the whether there is license to make sure it is open source project, how active the issues and pull requests are, how well the communication with the maintainer is done, and how well the project is explained on the Readme file or homepage and the code of conduct, which can be a signal of welcoming contributors.

After narrowing down to a total of four projects, it happened to be two of each fall into the same category and one I disliked another I liked.

### I liked...
1. Media Player - Kodi
The description is well organized on the homepage. Clearly, it was an open source project, and it was a welcoming atmosphere for the contributors as the apparition letter for them on the main page. The Github repository was actively working on issues and pull requests. The maintainer (?) seemed to try to response to those in a day. One thing that was unfortunate was that the instructions of how to install the program/software was not clear to me, so I have not used it yet. I will try to install it again soon.

### I disliked...
1. Command-line program to download videos from YouTube - youtube-dl
The overall management seemed to be out of control. I've lost interest in the project because of the lack of communication both with the developers(contributors) and especially regular users who might not know even what's the github.
