**`It is time to start searching for projects`**

## Q. It is time to start searching for projects. The above readings will help guide you in what to look for in a project. I will provide suggestions for where and how to look. In this week's blog, write about which projects you looked at, why you rejected them, which are still possible, and which look good to you. Treat your blog like a diary this week. Also comment on the talk by Karen Sandler.

Last week, I was searching the projects focusing on an issue with the First Timer label for my first open source contribution. Luckily, it wasn't hard to find issues because there were many projects encouraging people to have a contributing experience for Hacktoberfest. So, I did a few of them, and my pull requests were aceepted. I was thankful for what I have learned from the class like workflow and markdown without them, I might not able to try to contribute.

I decided to take a closer look at the project itself this week unlike before. I sorted projects through languages from CodeTriage and Up For Grabs mainly at C ++, HTML, JavaScript, Python, and Swift. First, I read a brief program description and went through Github repository to check how active the issues and pull requests are, and then put them on the list. Then, I started looking closely at each project. Based on the professor's advice, first, I checked the whether there is license to make sure it is open source project, how active the issues and pull requests are, how well the communication with the maintainer is done, and how well the project is explained on the Readme file or homepage and the code of conduct, which can be a signal of welcoming contributors.

After narrowing down to a total of four projects, it happened to be two of each fall into the same category and one I disliked another I liked.

### I liked...
1. **Media Player - Kodi**  
The description is well organized on the homepage. Clearly, it was an open source project, and it was a welcoming atmosphere for the contributors as the apparition letter for them on the main page. The Github repository was actively working on issues and pull requests. The maintainer (?) seemed to try to response to those in a day. One thing that was unfortunate was that the instructions of how to install the program/software was not clear to me, so I have not used it yet. I will try to install it again soon. 

2. **Business Process Management Software / Enterprise Resource Planning - ERPNext** 
I was interested in this type of program because one, I hope to have my own business in the future and two, I used to work in the accounting / management department before returning to the school. The homepage and Github repository are all well maintained. In the issue and pull request section of GitHub, communication seemed to be not coming and going, but I found a separate discussion forum later on.

### I disliked...
1. **Command-line program to download videos from YouTube - youtube-dl**  
The overall management seemed to be out of control. I've lost interest in the project because of the lack of communication both with the developers(contributors) and especially regular users who might not know even what's the github.  

2. **ERP and CRM - Odoo**  
Above all, the homepage was cluttered and lost interest.

The guest speaker talk presented by Karen Sandler gave me a lot of insights of the open-source project companies. It reminded me of my twenties who were upset against unfairness in terms of working. Not only directly related to the work and also the environment for females. I worked in the, how can I say hmmm, art field? My friends were writers for film, tv series, poem, novel, sing a song writers, painters, graphic designers, and all other forms of artists. There were young, passionate about what they are doing, but they were also na√Øve. They were happy to share their art pieces with others, didn't think of beyond. Their creative works stolen by others, especially well-known people who has power, it could be name value, money or something else. And they also didn't think of sustainability well to continue to work on their arts. I mean, money is not everything but, money is important to live daily life. I think tech field and art scene are pretty same. Especially, tech in open-source projects. I hope that I can run my startup in the future, and the talk made me a little bit scared about it. 

I couldn't stop thinking about the question and her answer from the talk - "What are some of the ways that you have considered for drawing more women into open source?". I have so many words to talk about it and I even feel my heart Is getting hotter because of not so pleasant reason, so I rather choose to be silent.
